This is the public reference repo for the paper "Sibling Variation in Phenotype and Genotype: Polygenic Trait Distributions and DNA Recombination Mapping with UK Biobank and IVF Family Data".



## Data Availability
### Raw data
All research and code in this paper used data from either UK Biobank or properiatary data from Genomic Prediction, Inc. (GP). The data is not included in this repo. 

Access to the UK Biobank resource is available via application (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).
GP datasets will not be made publicly available due to maintaining confidentiality of identifiable patient data.

### Results
The ~1.44 million recombination events found using the UKB siblings are available for use by other researchers under this DropBox link https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ehpd98fgsz1ab1w/AACkcZpBHRNzqlE-MorQsJqea?dl=0.
